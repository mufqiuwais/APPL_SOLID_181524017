Bahasa pemrograman : Java

## 1.Stream Progress Info

Refactor code for this task, so **Stream Progress Info** can work with different kinds of **Streams**. First make sure it works with **Music** too. Refactor code, so in the future if a **new kind of stream** is introduced, you will need **just to import one new class** with   **BytesSent** and **Length** getters in it.

Untuk Problem ini, saya amati code C# pada contoh sudah clean code yang artinya tidak perlu di refactor. Target atau tujuan yaitu **Stream Progress Info** dapat melayani berbagai jenis **Stream** telah terpenuhi. Maka dari itu saya hanya perlu menyamakan konsepnya, kemudian mengganti bahasanya ke Java, dan mencoba menambahkan kelas **Stream** baru dengan **BytesSent** dan **Length** getter di dalamnya.

## 2.Graphic Editor

Refactor code for this task, so **Graphic Editor can draw all kind of shapes** without checking, **what kind is concrete shape.** In the future new shapes will be added to system, so prepare the system for this moments. When you **add new shape** , you just should **add new class and nothing more**.



## 3.Detail Printer

Refactor code for this task, so **Detail Printer** don&#39;t need to ask **what kind of employee is passed to it**. Detail Printer need just to print details for all kind of employees. When new kind of employee is added you will need just to **add new class and nothing else.**

## 1.Recharge

You are given a library with the following classes

- Worker implements ISleeper
- Employee inherits Worker
- Robot inherits Worker
- RechargeStation

If you inspect the code, you can see that some of the classes have methods that they can&#39;t use (throw **UnsupportedOpperationException** ) which is clear indication that the code should be refactored.

Refactor the structure so that it conforms to the **Interface Segregation** principle.

> ### Hints
> Make the **Robot** to extend **Worker** and at the same time to implement **Rechargeable**

## 2.Security Door

You are given:

- SecurityManager
- abstract class SecurityCheck
- interface SecurityUI

**SecurityManager** which can interact with a user by validating his key card or by getting his pin code. Both methods are provided by an interface called **SecurityUI**. The validation is performed by the appropriate **SecurityCheck** class.

Refactor the structure so that it conforms to the **Interface Segregation** principle.

> ### Hints
> Split **SecurityUI** into smaller role interfaces, one for each **SecurityCheck** class
